### Summary

A hacky attempt at building a Saucelabs screenshotting tool

### TO DO

- Parallelize screenshot jobs
- Implement proper UI
- Open results page in new tab
- Thumbnail results 
- Display metadata for results (Browser, url, etc)
- Allow .zip download of all screenshots
- Remember users requests, to show a History list
- Allow user to re-fire jobs from the History list
- Implement custom webdriver wrapper to sanitize inputs

### DONE

- Allow user to (optionally) provide webdriver interaction commands, to execute before screenshot fires
